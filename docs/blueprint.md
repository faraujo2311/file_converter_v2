# **App Name**: DataForge

## Core Features:

- File Upload and Preview: Upload a file (Excel, PDF) and display its detected headers in a table for user review.
- Field Mapping and Type Definition: Map the column headers to predefined fields (matricula, cpf, RG, nome, e-mail) or create new custom fields. Define data types (Integer, Alphanumeric, Numeric, Accounting, Date, Text) and optional field lengths for each column.
- Output Format Configuration: Define output format (TXT positional, CSV with custom delimiter). For TXT, map input fields to output positions and lengths. For CSV, select a delimiter (pipe '|' or semicolon ';').

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and professional look.
- Secondary color: Dark gray (#333333) for text and important elements.
- Accent: Blue (#3498DB) for buttons and interactive elements to indicate action.
- Use a clear and structured layout with well-defined sections for file upload, field mapping, and output configuration.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for file types (Excel, PDF, TXT, CSV) and actions (upload, map, convert, download).
